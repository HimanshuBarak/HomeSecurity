## Description

I made this project as my Jcomponent for my Distributed Real Time System Course. I have used firebase authentication and firebase database for this project alongside with React Js.Working - 10 secs after the user logins sensor data for 3 sensors is generated randomly and send to firebase database. If the value of the sensors is greater than threshold values than a alert is displayed in the console. I have hosted this webapp using Firebase.

2. Install all the dependencies:
```
 npm install
```

3. To run
```

```
4. You will also need to create a firebase account and connect your react app to the firebase database.
